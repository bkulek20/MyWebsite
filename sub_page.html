    <h1>How to Host A Website from Github?</h1>
    <p>Here you can find detailed explanation</p>

    <br><br>

    <p2>I created a GitHub repository named MyWebsite. <br><br>
        Here is the link of the repo: https://github.com/bkulek20/MyWebsite <br><br>
        Then, I cloned the GitHub repo to VSCode using the “git clone” command  <br><br>
        
        After that, I planned my web app’s structure as followed: <br><br>
            index.html -> for the frontend <br>
            main.css -> for styling <br>
            app.js -> for adding functionality <br>
        I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for development. <br><br>
        
        To commit a change from VS Code to GitHub, I used the following commands: <br><br>
        git add .<br>
        git commit -m “comment”<br>
        git push origin main<br><br>
        
        To access my website and host it on GitHub, I first filled the index.html and main.css files. This displayed the content of my website. <br><br>
        To host the website from Github, I went to Settings -> Pages -> selected my main branch -> Save. Then, the link of my website became visible.<br><br>
    
        I realized that changes that I committed to GitHub were reflected on my website with a slight delay.</p2>
